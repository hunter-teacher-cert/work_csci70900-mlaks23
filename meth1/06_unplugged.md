Topic: Maze

Objective: SWBAT design a maze and provide explicit instructions for solving the maze. This lesson will prepare students for pair programming by practicing the driver/navigator model.

Grouping: Heterogeneously Paired

Warm-Up: Choose a volunteer. The volunteer will follow instructions to move from their desk to the classroom door. Call on students to give directions to the volunteer. When finished, discuss ways the instructions could have been improved.

Activity: Each person draws a maze with one entrance and one path to the exit on a piece of graph paper. Note: you cannot move diagonally within the maze. Each student will write explicit instructions for how to solve their maze. Then each partner takes turns instructing their partner in how to solve the maze without showing what the maze looks like. Person drawing should not say or ask any questions/comments.  At the end, each person shares their maze with their partner and compares their partnerâ€™s solution with their own. After each partner shares their maze solutions, they discuss how to improve the instructions.
