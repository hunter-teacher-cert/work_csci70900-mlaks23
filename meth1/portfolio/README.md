# Portfolio Lessons

## Lesson 1: Objects

## Lesson 2: Conditionals

### Note: These plans are based on lessons I taught during the week of 8/2/21 - 8/6/21 for students participating in the UpperLineCode Program. Some of the activities are based on UpperLineCode activities, but all have been adapted to suit my teaching style (i.e. lessons including *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*). I taught the students JavaScript and p5.js mainly using Repl.it. For this project, I adapted the coding activities to node.js so that I could run them using my terminal.
