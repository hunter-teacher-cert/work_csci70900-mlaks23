# Portfolio Lessons

### Note: These plans are based on lessons I taught during the week of 8/2/21 - 8/6/21 for students participating in the UpperLineCode Program. Some of the activities are based on UpperLineCode activities, but all have been adapted to suit my teaching style (i.e. lessons including Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). I taught the students JavaScript and p5.js mainly using Repl.it. For this project, I adapted the coding activities to node.js so they could I could run them using my terminal.
