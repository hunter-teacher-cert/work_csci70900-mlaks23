NetLogo Lesson Plan

Before students start coding using NetLogo, I'd have them explore the different models and play some of the games. The objective of this lesson is for students to find out what NetLogo can be used for.

Do Now: To begin the lesson, I would have the students explore the models. I would ask them to look at at least three different models (up to one game) and to write a description of what the model shows. After looking at the Interface for a few minutes, I would point out the "Info" tab so students could see the information about what the model shows and how it works. Then we would have a class discussion where I would have students describe the models they explored. This activity would help the students see the kinds of things they can do with the NetLogo.

Mini-Lesson: As a mini-lesson, I would have students all look at a specific model. For example, we could look at the Koch Curve model. We'd first look at the interface and I'd ask student to make predictions about what was happening. Next we'd look at the "Info" to verify the predictions and clarify some information. Then we could look at the "Code" tab to see the program. Students could read through the comments and try to figure out what the different parts do. At this point, I wouldn't go into too much detail about what all the specific commands do, but we could discuss the functions "setup," "step" and "iterate." 

Activity: As an activity, I'd have the students look at the code for the models they explored earlier. They could look at the comments and try to figure out what the functions do. I'd also have them compare the different codes and write down what the programs have in common and how they differ. If the programs are very long, I might have them find models with shorter programs. 

Summary: To end the lesson, I'd have a whole class discussion on their thoughts about NetLogo.
